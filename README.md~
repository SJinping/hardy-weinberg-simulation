Instructions

Overview
This C++ program simulates gene evolution that analyzed in the paper with or without spatial constraint.

The simulation procedure is divided into four stages: (i) initiation, (ii) mate selection, (iii) gamete generation and (iv) birth of the next generation.

An n√ón matrix is used to simulate the mating procedure. Each element of the matrix that presented an individual is initialized by a pair of genes (AA, Aa, or aa), which randomly generated from A or a according to a given probability in stage (i). In stage (ii), (iii) and (iv), each element is randomly mated by one of its 4 neighbors (G4), 6 neighbors (G6) or 8 neighbors (G8) in one loop. The loop stops till all elements constitute the same genes (either AA or aa). For the simulation without spatial constraint (Gnf), an element is randomly mated by any other element. When encounter boundary, a periodic boundary is applied to ensure that the neighboring condition of each element is the same. In each loop, number of gene A, gene a, and the distribution are recorded.

Simulation parameters are input manually and results are recorded in local text files.

progmain.cpp: 
main function and program entry. Neighbor type and spatial condition are defined in _tmain() function. Initialized parameters are also input in _tmain().

flower.h: 
Defines flower class, which implements mating progress, and files class, which deals with iostream.

function.h: 
Defines global functions that shared by all files.

Procedure
Input:
1. neighbor type should be predefined in progrmain.cpp.
2. after neighbor type is defined, run progmain.cpp.
3. In the end, the number of columns and rows, simulation times and random seed are requested to input in terminal.
4. When simulation finishes, the terminal will close automatically.

Output:
The number of generations for each simulation procedure and total time cost are recorded in generation.txt file. It will also generate a folder for each simulation named 00x, x for indexing. 

In each simulation folder, there are two text files named distribution and scores respectively.   distribution records the constitution of genes for each element in all loop. scores records the number of different genes for each loop.
